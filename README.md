## Project Overview

This project, `rtl_wer_visualizer`, is designed to evaluate the performance of real-time speech-to-text systems. 
It allow to compare hypothesis text (output of stt system) nad reference text (the gorund truth usaully trianscribed by human). 
This is designed to RTL lanaguages specifically. 
The result is the hyphotesis text with: 
- **substitute** - the wrong word in ðŸ”´ **RED** and below it the right word in ðŸŸ¢ **GREEN**
- **insertions** - words that the hypothesis provided that are not in the reference in ðŸ”µ **BLUE**
- **deletions** - words that the hypothesis did not mention but are in the reference in âšª **GRAY**

## Features

- Allow testing of STT server using a voice file and a text file with the actual transcription.
- Allow testing of STT output using a text file and a text file with the actual transcription.
- Enable visualization of the JIWER report.

## Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/rtl_stt_evaluator.git
cd rtl_stt_evaluator
poetry install
```

Make sure you have Python 3.11 installed. You can manage your Python versions using tools like `pyenv`.
