I build a Speach To Text Checker.

Direction: the app is in Right to Left language (Persian) and the text is in Persian.
Title: Persian STT Checker

you can send it a voice file (wav/mp3) and a reference text file (txt).
it will return text in Persian and English with the transcription of the voice file and fixes that it did.

below the title there are 2 part:
on the left side, there are 3 buttons: "Choose Voice File", "Choose Reference File", "Check".

This is the textually output of my server and what i want to happen on screen in terms of colors:
wrong words will be marked by <> and should be color in red.
fixed words will be marked () and should be color in green.
additions words will be marked by [] and should be color in blue.

write the code in index, styles and script files.
